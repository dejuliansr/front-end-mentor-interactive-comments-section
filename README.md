## My process

In this challenge I only used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript didn't use any framework so as not to complicate the configuration

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

By working on this challenge, I was able to learn various important concepts in front-end web development. I will understand how to create a semantic HTML structure, use TailwindCSS by implementing Flexbox and grids for responsive layouts, and manage images and text well, and I will also learn the implementation of JavaScript that I learned this time. used to retrieve data using the fetch function, add comments and reply to comments Overall, this helped improve my understanding of responsive design and best practices in front-end development.
